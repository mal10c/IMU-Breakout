# IMU-Breakout

IMU-Breakout is a Breakout clone.

I remember playing a breakout clone called brickles in grade school on Mac Classics.
If you've never heard of the Mac Classic (black and white 9 inch screen) then here's a

Breakout has always been one of my favourite games, and was actually one of the first
games I ever wrote.  I was in 9th grade or so when I wrote the game and didn't know the
first thing about programminng.  I found a copy of Visual Studio 6.0 or VB6 as I called
it and hacked away until the game worked.  Back then I didn't know about variables or
loops.  Being self taught I just hacked away until it worked.  For loops, I used timers,
and for variables I used label elements.  It actually worked pretty well in the end.

IMU-Breakout is a fun way to re-introduce breakout using Javascript.  Javascript
has quickly become one of my favorite programming langauges.

NOTE:
gyroscope and accelerometer horizontal displacement will need to be extracted to
determine position of the paddle.
